      <h2 id="faq">Frequently asked questions</h2>
      <p><strong>Is Prague safe?</strong> Petty theft is a problem, especially in major tourist areas in Prague. Pickpocketing is common at busy places and on public transport. Except for that, Prague is extremely safe compared to other European capitals. There are basically no shady areas and it's usually completely okay to walk anywhere you like, even in the night.</p>
      <p>If anything goes wrong, call the emergency number 112.</p>
      <p><strong>Is Prague friendly?</strong> It is, just remember that people might not be used to speaking foreign languages. Saying "nerozumeem" is the simplest way of telling them you don't understand Czech.</p>
      <p><strong>How should I move around the town?</strong> While <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a> is available in Prague, the <a href="https://www.liftago.com/">Liftago</a> app provides a very similar experience. Also, Prague has an excellent <a href="http://jizdnirady.idnes.cz/praha/spojeni?lng=e">system of public transport</a>, which includes three lines of metro, trams, and buses.</p>
      <p>With Czech SIM card, you can use <a href="http://www.smsjizdenka.cz/MATicketsDPP/sms/index.do">SMS tickets</a>, otherwise you need to buy <a href="http://www.dpp.cz/en/fares-in-prague/">paper ones</a> in yellow ticket machines. During the conference you should be okay with regular 30 min tickets for 24 CZK. Zone P includes everything you need, even the airport area.</p>
      <p>In the night there is a different, limited system of public transport and the metro is completely out of order. The last train usually goes around midnight. Depending on your route it still might be okay to take public transport, but calling <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a> or <a href="https://www.liftago.com">Liftago</a> is usually less tiring.</p>

      <h2 id="accommodation-tips" class="anchor">Accommodation tips</h2>
      <p>Both <a href="https://www.airbnb.cz/s/Prague--Czech-Republic">Airbnb</a> and <a href="http://www.booking.com/city/cz/prague.html">Booking.com</a> are at your service in Prague. For adventurous minds, there's always also <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.com/places/europe/czech-republic/prague">CouchSurfing</a>.</p>

      <h2 id="the-czech-republic" class="anchor">The Czech Republic</h2>
      <p>Never been to the Czech Republic? Here's some <strong>practical info</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We pay with <strong>CZK</strong> (abbr. Kč, "koruna"). ATMs are omnipresent. There are money exchange booths in the city center, which offer better deals than banks and no fees, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHNzBvFXmf4&list=PLM9_KZNJw8qGuEHJf4lcfIiGwpiRtcKAm&index=8">be cautious which you choose</a>. The exchange rate is approx. 1 EUR = 27 CZK. Cards are accepted in chains and larger places, but not so often in smaller shops, coffee places, pubs. It's useful to carry around some cash.</li>
        <li>We speak Czech and understand Slovak perfectly. <strong>English</strong> should be well understood, especially among younger generations. <strong>German</strong> can work as a fallback, as well as any other Slavic language.</li>
        <li>While June is usually sunny and can bring very warm days to Prague, it's good to be ready also for chilly, rainy days. It can be 30°C with clear blue sky as well as 15°C with heavy, London-like rain.</li>
        <li>We use 230 V electric plugs, <a href="http://www.power-plugs-sockets.com/czech-republic/">type E power sockets</a>.</li>
