Dear Pythonista!

Thank you very much for your talk proposal. Unfortunately, it didn't make it to the first selection. However, we liked it so much that we put it on the waiting list. This means that if any selected speakers cancel (within the next few days), we will contact you and ask if you are still interested.

Also, please note that there were some changes made to the date and location of PyCon CZ 2017. You can find more information at https://cz.pycon.org/2017/.

We hope that this hasn't caused much inconvenience for you. Looking forward to seeing you at PyCon CZ 2017!

Take care,
PyCon CZ 2017 organisers team
